	    The web page you are watching was served by a simple web
	    server running on top of the lightweight TCP/IP stack <a
	    href="http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/">lwIP</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce
	    the RAM usage while still having a full scale TCP. This
	    makes lwIP suitable for use in embedded systems with tens
	    of kilobytes of free RAM and room for around 40 kilobytes
	    of code ROM.
